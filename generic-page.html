					<p> Project Hope Foundation is a non-profit organization focused towards people of all ages with autism. This organization
					has grown over the years to now have 8 different locations for services in South Carolina. HOPE is an accranem that stands for
					“Help Our Potential Emerge.” This organization was started by two moms with boys that were diagnosed with autism in 1996. The rate of
					autism in kids was 1 in 2,500 and both of these women had a son with the diagnosis. They knew their boys needed some extra help to succeed
					and they began the mission to create an organization that will help anyone with autism.</p>
					<p>My client has a strong social media presence. They interact with their followers strongly. Recently, they had a tshirt design
					contest and allowed people to submit their designs to go in the running. They are known strongly by the acreanem HOPE as well as the painted-like
					sunshine as the logo.</p>
					<p>The website for Project Hope Foundation is full of information and imagery, but there is a lack of organization and flow to the
					information they have. The use of photos brings their project to life by assosiating it with real people, but the overlap with text takes
					away from the purpose of the information and the special moments captured in photos.</p>
