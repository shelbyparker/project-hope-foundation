						<h1>Audience and Goals</h1>
						<p class="info">This assignment led to determining the specific audience that this website is for, as well as, the main goals it is trying to achieve.</p>
					</header>
					<header>
						<h2>Determine the Audience</h2>
					</header>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/autism affected small.jpg" alt="stickynotes"  /></span></div>
							<div class="8u$"><p>The audience that needs help ranges
								from all ages that have been diagnosed with autism. With autism being diagnosed
								as early as 18 months old, the website needs to reach parents and guardians as well as teens and adults all the
								way to the elderly who feel they need help with their own struggle with autism. With the spectrum being so spread
								out those that are daignosed may have very different needs. With all of this, the site needs to vary.</p></div>
							<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/volunteers.jpg" alt="stickynotes" /></span></div>
							<div class="8u$"><p>After the immediate audience directly
								affected by autism there is a need to reach those that will want to volunteer and possibly donate to the Project Hope
								Foundation. This process began by considering who would be the people able to help the diagnosed the best.
								I found that teachers and therapists are key to the transformation of these people's lives. After that comes volunteers
								of parents and potentially high school students earning volunteer hours. These people not only affect the autistic students,
								but it brings new light and hope to their own lives.</p></div>
							<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/skeptics.jpg" alt="stickynotes" /></span></div>
							<div class="8u$"><p>Lastly, I identified the skeptics. These are the people who feel autism does not even exist or that
								people who have this diagnosis do not deserve special attention to learn skills that would benefit them in life. </p></div>
