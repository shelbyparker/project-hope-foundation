						<h1>Interviews</h1>
						<p class="info">At this stage of the research, talking to people involved with the chosen
							non-profit organization is key.</p>
					</header>
					<p>I conducted two separate interviews to get a perspective into the user experince. I interviewed Elizabeth Bushéy, Project Hope's HR and
					Communications Manager, and TJ Galloway, Special Education teacher at D.W. Daniel High School. The first interview was focused on the desired
					goals of Project Hope for the website, but the second interview focused on how the teacher felt using the website.</p>

						<h2>Elizabeth Bushéy</h2>

					<div class="row">
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/elizabeth.jpg" alt="Elizabeth"  /></span></div>
						<div class="8u$"><p><b>Why did you choose to be apart of Project Hope Foundation?</b></p>
						<p>"I've been affiliated with the organization for over 10 years. I was in the coporate world for 25 years
							working with workforce solutions with Fortune 500, fortune 1000 companies. I had a business partner who was
							on the board of Project Hope and learned about the organization through him. Personally, I got to the point
							in my life in my career where I was interested in making a change. I had always wanted to contribute to an
							organization that I felt had a mission and made a difference in people's lives and Project Hope is that kind
							of place."</p>
						<p><b>Provide a bried overview of the Project Hope Foundation.</b></p>
						<p>"Project Hope provides educational and therapeutic services to individuals affected by autism, so that
							includes the individuals themselves on the autism spectrum as well as their families. We have parent services
							and everything from education and clincal to parent training for individuals from birth to adulthood. So, it's
							a broad range of services and it's everything from when individuals are first diagnosed to our adult services
							programs for individuals in their 20-30s."</p>
							<p><b>What are the main goals of the organization?</b></p>
							<p>"The main goals of the organization are to provide quality services that are serving individuals to achieve
								their highest potential."</p>
								<p><b>What are the main goals of the organization's website?</b></p>
								<p>"I think obviously to understand who we are, what our vaulues are, and our mission. Also, to provide
									direction to either individuals who want to work for us or families who are interested in our services.
									Make sure there is a plave to apply and the scope of what we do."</p>
									<p><b>Who is the primary audience that is going to be viewing the website?</b></p>
									<p>"Well, if it's an employee, potential employees would be someone who is interested in a job that makes
										a difference and that desire to serve with the special needs community, in particular, autism. If it's
										a family, it would be someone or families who either haven't had success somewhere else with their family
										member with autism or newly diagnosed families."</p>
										<p><b>Where do your donations come from?</b></p>
										<p>"Some donations come from charitable organizations, such as the United Way, just as an example. We also
											have private donors, a lot from the local communities. Some from businesses affiliated with families, some
											are family members and we also get a lot of support through grants."</p>
											<p><b>What are the most important features of the website?</b></p>
											<p>"Definitely want to provide information as the primary, and secondary my thought is that people could
												get a feel for our culture and values.."</p>
												<p><b>Who are your volunteers?</b></p>
												<p>"We dont require any particular background in order to work for us. We train everybody the same way
													so that even if they've had some experience we do training and make sure that it is consistenly done.
													The way we do ABA therapy the qualifications really are someone who wants to make a difference who has
													the desire to help. A lot of people do have some sort of idea about it, either backround in school with
													psychology, or they know someone with a special need or just love kids and have worked in childcare."</p></div>

						<h2>TJ Galloway</h2>

					<div class="row">
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/tj.jpg" alt="TJ" /></span></div>
						<div class="8u$"><p>This interview looked a bit different from Elizabeth Bushéy's interview, as TJ was focusing on
						the user experience. I asked Mr. Galloway to talk me through the site from pro's and con's. The front page displays the different
						services availble and a way to apply to volunteer. He felt these were strong points of interest. He felt the website
						is easy to navigate. The pros came more in the details of the site, such as, wording and overwhelming amounts of information. He
					struggled to eaily know the age range these programs are for. As a teacher, he felt he could understand the terminology well, but parents
					might struggle to understand or feel overwhelmed. </p></div>
