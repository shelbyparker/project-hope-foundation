						<p> Autism has not just one type, but many different ones. This disorder

						According the Centers for Disease Control, autism affects 1 in 54 children
						in the US today. Autism types vary, but are influenced by a combination
						of genetic and environmental factors. Autism is considered a spectrum
						disorder, but each person falls at a different place on the spectrum.
						Each person has a distinct set of strengths and challenges. Signs of Autism
						are usually apparent by the ages of 2 or 3, but sometimes as early as 18 months.</p>

						<p> The first thing to appear on this site is a large section about learning more
						about the candidates of the 2020 election. There is a learn more call to action button
						for people to access resources sharing who upholds the values that back Autism. Below
						there is a brief description of what autism is and then a call to action to learn more.

							<h3>Acumen</h3>
							<p>The home page for the Acumen website has a strong user interaction. Throughout this page
							as the user scrolls new images, links, information appear. The user is more likely to engage with this
							information because it is in motion. The movement is subtle but interacts with the user enough to
							control where his/her eye is drawn to.</p>
							<p>Another feature that works well is the menu bar at the top of the page. The menu bar stays fixed as
							the user scrolls down the page. The constant option for the user to engage with other pages is key for easy
							navigation. Within the details of the menu bar, the donate "button" is very effective in the pink color type
							while changing to white type and the pink background with the drop down menu. The rest of the options in the
							menu bar are more subtle but are easily navigated by any user.</p><br><br>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/invisible children.png" alt="Permanent housing page" /></span>
							<h3>Invisible Children</h3>
							<p>This site does an exceptional job of using type with images. The section under "Communities Making Communities
								Safe" displays the use of text, type, and color. This type of image menu is engaging to the user's eye as it interacts
								with each move of the mouse. The site uses images in a block section and then has a strong use of white
								space after to break up the images and let the information breathe.</p><br><br>
