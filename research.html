					<h1>Research</h1>
					<p>I conducted research about the Project Hope Foundation as my primary research and the secondary research was directed towards how other autism sites are used.
					Following the research, I interviewed two key people in determining the main goals for this site. </p>
				</header>
				<h2>Primary client research</h2>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/original site.png" alt="old GCHC website" /></span>
					<p> Project Hope Foundation is a non-profit organization focused towards people of all ages with autism. This organization
					has grown over the years to now have 8 different locations for services in South Carolina. HOPE is an accranem that stands for
					“Help Our Potential Emerge.” This organization was started by two moms with boys that were diagnosed with autism in 1996. The rate of
					autism in kids was 1 in 2,500 and both of these women had a son with the diagnosis. They knew their boys needed some extra help to succeed
					and they began the mission to create an organization that will help anyone with autism.</p>
					<p>My client has a strong social media presence. They interact with their followers strongly. Recently, they had a tshirt design
					contest and allowed people to submit their designs to go in the running. They are known strongly by the acreanem HOPE as well as the painted-like
					sunshine as the logo.</p>
					<p>The website for Project Hope Foundation is full of information and imagery, but there is a lack of organization and flow to the
					information they have. The use of photos brings their project to life by assosiating it with real people, but the overlap with text takes
					away from the purpose of the information and the special moments captured in photos.</p>

					<h2>Secondary Research</h2>

				<p> Autism has not just one type, but many different ones. This disorder
				refers to a broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with
				social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communications.
				According the Centers for Disease Control, autism affects 1 in 54 children
				in the US today. Autism types vary, but are influenced by a combination
				of genetic and environmental factors. Autism is considered a spectrum
				disorder, but each person falls at a different place on the spectrum.
				Each person has a distinct set of strengths and challenges. Signs of Autism
				are usually apparent by the ages of 2 or 3, but sometimes as early as 18 months.</p>

				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/autism speaks.png" alt="Strategies to End Homelessness website" /></span>
						<h3>Autism Speaks</h3>
						<p>This site begins with a thorough description of Autism. As you scroll
						there are call to action buttons features at sections to access more information.
						There is one for how to learn the signs of Autism, a section for resources,
						a call to action directed towards adults and teens who feel they might have signs.</p>
						<p>One important feature on this site is having multiple sections that apply to different groups
						of people to help them learn more in the areas they need. As one continues reading they share
						news articles that are happening right now in hopes to keep the community informed.</p><br></br>
				<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/autism society.png" alt="Shelter and outreach page" /></span>
						<h3>Autism Society</h3>
						<p>The first thing to appear on this site is a large section about learning more
						about the candidates of the 2020 election. There is a learn more call to action button
						for people to access resources sharing who upholds the values that back Autism. Below
						there is a brief description of what autism is and then a call to action to learn more.
						Following are two stories from real people and a call to read more button. After is a
						resources section for the location options and contact. Lastly is recent news associated
						with Autism.</p><br><br>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/sc autism.png" alt="Permanent housing page" /></span>
						<h3>South Carolina Autism Society</h3>
						<p>One the front page there is a slideshow with a welcome image and following
						are two call to action buttons for donating and learning more. Next there is a
						description of what the South Carolina Autism Society is and then a "how you can help"
						section. An inset box is next with the purpose of this society with a call to action.
						They have a section about events, volunteer opportunities, covid 19 resources, and lastly
						a brief section of what autism is.</p><br><br>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/acumen.png" alt="Shelter and outreach page" /></span>
						<h3>Acumen</h3>
						<p>The home page for the Acumen website has a strong user interaction. Throughout this page
						as the user scrolls new images, links, information appear. The user is more likely to engage with this
						information because it is in motion. The movement is subtle but interacts with the user enough to
						control where his/her eye is drawn to.</p>
						<p>Another feature that works well is the menu bar at the top of the page. The menu bar stays fixed as
						the user scrolls down the page. The constant option for the user to engage with other pages is key for easy
						navigation. Within the details of the menu bar, the donate "button" is very effective in the pink color type
						while changing to white type and the pink background with the drop down menu. The rest of the options in the
						menu bar are more subtle but are easily navigated by any user.</p><br><br>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/invisible children.png" alt="Permanent housing page" /></span>
						<h3>Invisible Children</h3>
						<p>This site does an exceptional job of using type with images. The section under "Communities Making Communities
							Safe" displays the use of text, type, and color. This type of image menu is engaging to the user's eye as it interacts
							with each move of the mouse. The site uses images in a block section and then has a strong use of white
							space after to break up the images and let the information breathe.</p><br><br>

						<h1>Interviews</h1>
						<p class="info">At this stage of the research, talking to people involved with the chosen
							non-profit organization is key.</p>
					</header>
					<p>I conducted two separate interviews to get a perspective into the user experince. I interviewed Elizabeth Bushéy, Project Hope's HR and
					Communications Manager, and TJ Galloway, Special Education teacher at D.W. Daniel High School. The first interview was focused on the desired
					goals of Project Hope for the website, but the second interview focused on how the teacher felt using the website. After finishing the
					interviews, I learned that most of my goals were spot on, but a few things should be tweaked. The main thing I learned is to make sure
					I place a focus on Project Hope's values and their mission first thing.</p>

						<h2>Elizabeth Bushéy</h2>

					<div class="row">
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/elizabeth.jpg" alt="Elizabeth"  /></span></div>
						<div class="8u$"><p><b>Why did you choose to be apart of Project Hope Foundation?</b></p>
						<p>"I've been affiliated with the organization for over 10 years. I was in the coporate world for 25 years
							working with workforce solutions with Fortune 500, fortune 1000 companies. I had a business partner who was
							on the board of Project Hope and learned about the organization through him. Personally, I got to the point
							in my life in my career where I was interested in making a change. I had always wanted to contribute to an
							organization that I felt had a mission and made a difference in people's lives and Project Hope is that kind
							of place."</p>
						<p><b>Provide a bried overview of the Project Hope Foundation.</b></p>
						<p>"Project Hope provides educational and therapeutic services to individuals affected by autism, so that
							includes the individuals themselves on the autism spectrum as well as their families. We have parent services
							and everything from education and clincal to parent training for individuals from birth to adulthood. So, it's
							a broad range of services and it's everything from when individuals are first diagnosed to our adult services
							programs for individuals in their 20-30s."</p>
							<p><b>What are the main goals of the organization?</b></p>
							<p>"The main goals of the organization are to provide quality services that are serving individuals to achieve
								their highest potential."</p>
								<p><b>What are the main goals of the organization's website?</b></p>
								<p>"I think obviously to understand who we are, what our vaulues are, and our mission. Also, to provide
									direction to either individuals who want to work for us or families who are interested in our services.
									Make sure there is a plave to apply and the scope of what we do."</p>
									<p><b>Who is the primary audience that is going to be viewing the website?</b></p>
									<p>"Well, if it's an employee, potential employees would be someone who is interested in a job that makes
										a difference and that desire to serve with the special needs community, in particular, autism. If it's
										a family, it would be someone or families who either haven't had success somewhere else with their family
										member with autism or newly diagnosed families."</p>
										<p><b>Where do your donations come from?</b></p>
										<p>"Some donations come from charitable organizations, such as the United Way, just as an example. We also
											have private donors, a lot from the local communities. Some from businesses affiliated with families, some
											are family members and we also get a lot of support through grants."</p>
											<p><b>What are the most important features of the website?</b></p>
											<p>"Definitely want to provide information as the primary, and secondary my thought is that people could
												get a feel for our culture and values.."</p>
												<p><b>Who are your volunteers?</b></p>
												<p>"We dont require any particular background in order to work for us. We train everybody the same way
													so that even if they've had some experience we do training and make sure that it is consistenly done.
													The way we do ABA therapy the qualifications really are someone who wants to make a difference who has
													the desire to help. A lot of people do have some sort of idea about it, either backround in school with
													psychology, or they know someone with a special need or just love kids and have worked in childcare."</p></div>

						<h2>TJ Galloway</h2>

					<div class="row">
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/tj.jpg" alt="TJ" /></span></div>
						<div class="8u$"><p>This interview looked a bit different from Elizabeth Bushéy's interview, as TJ was focusing on
						the user experience. I asked Mr. Galloway to talk me through the site from pro's and con's. The front page displays the different
						services availble and a way to apply to volunteer. He felt these were strong points of interest. He felt the website
						is easy to navigate. The pros came more in the details of the site, such as, wording and overwhelming amounts of information. He
					struggled to eaily know the age range these programs are for. As a teacher, he felt he could understand the terminology well, but parents
					might struggle to understand or feel overwhelmed. </p></div>
