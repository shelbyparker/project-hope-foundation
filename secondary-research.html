					<p> Autism has not just one type, but many different ones. This disorder
					refers to a broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with
					social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communications.
					According the Centers for Disease Control, autism affects 1 in 54 children
					in the US today. Autism types vary, but are influenced by a combination
					of genetic and environmental factors. Autism is considered a spectrum
					disorder, but each person falls at a different place on the spectrum.
					Each person has a distinct set of strengths and challenges. Signs of Autism
					are usually apparent by the ages of 2 or 3, but sometimes as early as 18 months.</p>
